# 🔹 TASK 1: Certificate Troubleshooting (User-Submitted Tickets)

Three certificate-related issues were reviewed and resolved.

---

## 📝 **Ticket 1 — Certificate Error When Accessing via IP**
**Submitted by:** Bob Wood (Pen Tester)  
**Issue:** Browser shows certificate error when the website is accessed via IP.

### ✔ Root Cause  
Certificates are issued to domain names, not IP addresses.

### ✔ Solution  
**Use FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)** instead of accessing the website through its IP address.

---

## 📝 **Ticket 2 — Certificate Appears Expired, Despite Renewal**
**Submitted by:** Sheila Shaz (System Administrator)

### ✔ Root Cause  
System time mismatch due to **NTP failure** caused the certificate to appear expired.

### ✔ Solution  
Check NTP service → synchronize system time → confirm no time drift.

---

## 📝 **Ticket 3 — Root Certificate Not Trusted**
**Submitted by:** James Clay (Software Developer)

### ✔ Root Cause  
Client system missing trusted root CA certificates.

### ✔ Solution  
Update the **client root certificate store** and ensure all approved Root CAs are installed.

---

# 🔹 TASK 2: Cloud Inbound Rule Configuration

The VM hosting the bank’s website must be secure, allowing only specific connections.

### ✔ Requirements
- Public HTTPS access  
- RDP & SSH restricted to a single authorized IP: **18.66.78.112**  
- Certificate already configured  

### ✔ Final Inbound Rules (as required)

| Type  | Protocol | Port Range | Source |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| HTTPS | TCP | 443 | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| RDP   | TCP | 3389 | 18.66.78.112/32 |
| SSH   | TCP | 22 | 18.66.78.112/32 |

### 🔒 Security Notes
- `0.0.0.0/0` = access from anywhere (IPv4)  
- `/32` = single host access only  
- Strict IP whitelisting ensures hardened access control  

---

# 🔹 TASK 3: VPN Connectivity Architecture Design

The bank requires two remote VPN connections:

- **Software Developers (Ubuntu 20.04)**  
- **General Remote Staff (Windows 10)**  

Both require:
- 256-bit strong encryption  
- SSL/TLS for key exchange  

---

## 🔸 **VPN Connection 1 – Ubuntu Developers**

### ✔ Requirements  
- Connect from home → enterprise software repository  
- Use an open-source VPN protocol optimized for speed  
- Route **all** traffic through enterprise network (full tunnel)

### ✔ Recommended Solution  
| User/OS | VPN Type | Protocol | Tunnel | Port |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------|------|
| Ubuntu | Host-to-Host | **OpenVPN** | Full | **UDP 1194** |

---

## 🔸 **VPN Connection 2 – Windows 10 Users**

### ✔ Requirements  
- Connect from home → enterprise network  
- Use Microsoft proprietary protocol  
- Enable **split tunneling** (Netflix allowed outside VPN)

### ✔ Recommended Solution  
| User/OS | VPN Type | Protocol | Tunnel | Port |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------|------|
| Windows 10 | Host-to-Site | **SSTP** | Split | **TCP 443** |
