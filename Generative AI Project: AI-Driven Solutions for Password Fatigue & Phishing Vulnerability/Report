## 🔹 **Step 1: AI Solution for Password Management & Phishing Detection**

A detailed report was generated using GenAI covering:

- Introduction to password fatigue  
- Consequences of weak passwords  
- How AI mitigates password-related risks  
- Sample Python code for password generation  

The AI provided a runnable script saved as **pass.py**, executed using:

```bash
python pass.py
Output:
The script generated strong passwords dynamically and displayed results in PowerShell.

🔹 Step 2: AI-Based Phishing Email Detection System

Using a GenAI prompt, we generated:

Overview of phishing techniques

Signs of suspicious emails

Explanation of AI detection

Python code for model-based phishing detection

The generated Python script was run in PowerShell and produced:

✔ Classification of phishing vs. legitimate emails
✔ Ability to analyze datasets
✔ AI-aided email filtering logic

Output:
AI successfully identified phishing patterns from provided sample data.

🔹 Step 3: Chrome Extension for Password Management (GenAI)

GenAI generated:

Step-by-step Chrome extension setup

manifest.json

popup.html

background.js (password generator code)

Execution Steps:

Run JSON code in PowerShell

Run HTML code in PowerShell

Run JavaScript in VS Code

Load unpacked extension in Chrome

Output:
Each time the user clicks Generate Password, a new secure password is created.

🚨 6. Key Findings
✔ Password Fatigue Mitigation

AI-generated passwords significantly reduce user-generated weaknesses.

✔ Automated Phishing Detection

AI model correctly flags phishing indicators such as:

Urgency

Spoofed senders

Suspicious links

Unusual content structures

✔ Chrome Extension Benefits

Instant secure password creation

Eliminates human error

Reduces reuse of weak passwords

📉 7. Risk Reduction Impact
