# 📘 1. Project Overview

The objective of this engagement was to conduct a **Vulnerability Assessment (VA)** and **Penetration Testing (PT)** on:

- **Windows 10 System** – *172.31.8.240*  
- **Ubuntu/Debian Linux System** – *172.31.11.86*

The assessment aimed to:
- Identify vulnerabilities  
- Validate security misconfigurations  
- Analyze risk impact  
- Provide actionable remediation

# 🎯 2. Client Problem Statement

The organization lacked visibility into the security posture of two internal systems.  
They required:

- A security assessment of Windows & Linux endpoints  
- Identification of potential attack paths  
- A detailed technical + business-level remediation plan  
- Validation of exposure to known CVEs and misconfigurations

Their primary concerns included:
- Weak encryption  
- Outdated protocols  
- Certificate issues  
- Exposed services

# 🧩 3. Scope of Engagement

### **In Scope**
- Network scanning  
- Port enumeration  
- Service fingerprinting  
- Vulnerability scanning (Windows & Linux)  
- Risk scoring  
- Recommendations  

### **Out of Scope**
- Exploitation beyond safe validation  
- Denial-of-service testing  
- Physical security  
- Social engineering

# 🛠️ 4. Tools & Methodology

### **Tools Used**
- **Zenmap (Nmap GUI)** – Reconnaissance, topology mapping  
- **Nessus Essentials** – Vulnerability scanning  
- **Linux Terminal** – Installation & service management  

(Documented across Pages 1–5 of the report.) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### **Methodology**
1. Information Gathering  
2. Enumeration & Service Discovery  
3. Vulnerability Scanning (Automated)  
4. Manual Validation  
5. Risk Classification  
6. Reporting

# 🛰️ 5. Information Gathering

### **IP Identification** (Page 7)  
- Windows: **172.31.8.240**  
- Ubuntu: **172.31.11.86**  

Zenmap topology revealed active nodes and open services.

# 🔍 6. Enumeration Findings

### **Windows 10 — Open Ports** (Page 8)
- 3389 (RDP)  
- 5357 (HTTP)  
- 8443 (HTTPS)

### **Ubuntu — Open Ports** (Page 9)
- 22 (SSH)  
- 631 (CUPS)  
- 443 (HTTPS)

Version information was captured for all services.

# 🚨 7. Key Vulnerabilities Identified

Data referenced from Pages 13–17 of the report. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## **Windows 10 | Major Issues**
### 🔴 High
- **SWEET32 Vulnerability**  
  Weak 3DES cipher in use.

### 🟠 Medium
- TLS 1.0 & 1.1 enabled  
- Self-signed SSL certificates  
- Untrusted certificates  
- RDP without NLA  

---

## **Ubuntu / Debian | Major Issues**
### 🟠 Medium
- **Terrapin Attack** (CVE-2023-48795)  
- **CUPS Remote Printer Registration** (CVE-2024-47176)  
- SSL expired/self-signed certificates  
- Outdated services  

---

# 📊 8. Severity Summary

| Severity | Windows | Ubuntu |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Critical | 0 | 0 |
| High | 1 | 0 |
| Medium | 5 | 5 |
| Low/Info | 26 | 30+ |

(From Page 14 of the report.) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

# 🛠️ 9. Root Cause Analysis

## Windows 10
- Legacy encryption protocols enabled  
- Incomplete TLS hardening  
- Default certificate configurations  
- Weak authentication for remote access  

## Ubuntu/Linux
- Outdated packages lacking security patches  
- Excessive services exposed externally (CUPS)  
- Poor certificate lifecycle management  

---

# 🧭 10. Recommendations (High Priority)

## Windows
- Disable 3DES cipher suites  
- Enforce TLS 1.2+  
- Replace all self-signed SSL certificates  
- Enable NLA for RDP  

## Ubuntu
- Patch OpenSSH (Terrapin fix)  
- Restrict / disable CUPS service  
- Replace expired/self-signed certificates  

---

# 📈 11. Business Impact

If left unaddressed, these vulnerabilities could lead to:

- Man-in-the-middle attacks  
- Unauthorized access via weak RDP settings  
- Privacy breaches due to weak SSL/TLS  
- Lateral movement in the internal network  
- Credential interception

# 📥 12. Deliverables Provided

- Full VAPT Report (PDF)  
- Zenmap and Nessus output screenshots  
- Risk classification tables  
- Technical remediation guidance  

(Report sourced from the uploaded document.) :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

# 🧾 13. Conclusion

The systems evaluated showed **medium to high-risk vulnerabilities** mainly caused by encryption weaknesses, outdated services, and poor certificate hygiene.

Remediation actions such as patching, service restriction, and secure configuration will significantly reduce the attack surface and improve the organization’s overall security posture.
